## A. Installation when you run webdbviewer as CGI script

Download tar.gz archive, expand it and change directory:

    curl -kL https://github.com/yuki-kimoto/webdbviewer/archive/latest.tar.gz > webdbviewer-latest.tar.gz
    tar xf webdbviewer-latest.tar.gz
    mv webdbviewer-latest webdbviewer
    cd webdbviewer

Setup. Needed module is installed.

    ./setup.sh

Check setup. Run the following command.

    prove t

If "syntax OK" is displayed, setup is sucseed.

You must set database information in **webdbviewer.conf**.
database type, database name, user, password, host, or port.
(; is comment line)

    [basic]
    ;;; Database type
    ; dbtype=mysql
    ; dbtype=sqlite
    dbtype=mysql

    ;;; Database name
    dbname=myproject

    ;;; User
    user=kimoto

    ;;; Password
    password=secret

    ;;; Host
    ;host=yourhost.com

    ;;; Port
    ;port=1234
    
You can access the following URL.

    http://yourhost/somepath/webdbviewer/webdbviewer.cgi

### If you see Internal Server Error

If you see an internal server error, look at the log file (webdbviewer/log/production.log)
to see what problem has occurred.

### Additional work when you don't run CGI script by your user.

If CGI script isn't run by your user, you need the following work.
For example, CGI script is run by apache user.

Change user and group of all files in webdbviewer directory to apache 

    chown -R apache:apache webdbviewer

In this case, you server need to execute CGI.
Check apache config file.

For example, you need the following config.

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    </Directory>

## B. Installation when you run webdbviewer as embdded web server

webdbviewer has its own web server,
so you can start using the application very easily.
In this way, performance is much better than CGI.

### Create webdbviewer user

Create a **webdbviewer** user. This is not necessary, but recommended:

    useradd webdbviewer
    su - webdbviewer
    cd ~

    curl -kL https://github.com/yuki-kimoto/webdbviewer/archive/latest.tar.gz > webdbviewer-latest.tar.gz
    tar xf webdbviewer-latest.tar.gz
    mv webdbviewer-latest webdbviewer

It is useful to write configuration in ***webdbviewer.my.conf***
, not webdbviewer.conf.
